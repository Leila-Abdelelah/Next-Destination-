# Next-Destination-

Next Destination is a simple recommender for travel destinations that helps users find their ideal travel spots based on their preferences. Users can input different details like their budget, preferred weather, and favorite activities, and the app will suggest suitable destinations. The app will provide recommendations using a predefined list of destinations. 


# 1. GIT 

For this project, I used Git for version control, which helped me track changes and manage different tasks. I worked with branching to isolate tasks and merging to bring everything together. I also experimented with Gitâ€™s "time travel" commands like git reset to revisit earlier states of the project.   

# 2. UML Diagrams 

I created four diagrams to visualize the system: a Use-Case Diagram to show user interactions, a Class Diagram to outline the structure of the code, an Activity Diagram to break down the flow of processes and a Component diagram. These diagrams helped me understand the big picture and refine the design.

# 3. Requirements 

I wrote down detailed requirements for the project and managed them in tools like Notion and Jira. These requirements are linked to project goals like user preferences, budget filters, and weather conditions.  

# 4. Analysis 

I made a checklist of key points from the analysis phase and applied them to evaluate my project. The analysis report covers areas like scalability, performance, and user satisfaction. It also includes some prompts I used to get ideas for improving my project.   

# 5. Domain-Driven Design (DDD) 

I worked on identifying different domains using Event Storming and mapped them into a Core Domain Chart. The relationships between these domains are visualized in a diagram, showing how the parts of the system connect and interact.

# 7. Clean Code Development 

I applied clean code practices like meaningful variable names, small and focused functions, and avoiding duplication. A cheat sheet summarizing these principles is also included.

# 9. Build Management 

I used Gradle to automate tasks like compiling code, running tests, and generating documentation. These tasks made the development process more efficient.
